# Day 7: 8 January 2025

> **Goal**: Complete Responsive Club Website project

## What I Learned

- Started learning about the DOM
  - `<script src='example.js'></script>`
  - loaded and executed in order of placement in the document (html)
  - `defer` attribute - ensures that the entire HTML file has been parsed before the script is executed
  - `async` attribute - allows HTML parser to continue parsing as the script is being downloaded, but will execute immediately after it has downloaded
