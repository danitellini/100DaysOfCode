# Day 02: 2 January 2025

> **Goal**: Complete the Colmar Academy project.

## What I Accomplished

- JavaScript Debugging
  - Learned how to go about debugging JS code via MDN, Stack Overflow, and the stack trace.

## Challenges

- None, was fairly straightforward. The debugging practice was mild.
- I didn't have time to sit at a computer today, so I was unable to do anything on the Colmar Academy project.
