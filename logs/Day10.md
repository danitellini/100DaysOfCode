> **Goal**: Complete Responsive Club Website project

## What I Accomplished

- DOM Events with JS
  - `.addEventListener` method registers events to DOM elements
    - Takes two arguments: event type, event handler function
    - When triggered on event target, registered event handler function executes
    - Multiple event handler functions to a single event is possible
  - Event handler functions can be registered as values of `onevent` properties of their event target
  - `.target`, `.type`, `.timeStamp` event object properties provide information about event
  - `.removeEventListener` method stops specific event handlers from firing on specific events
- Started Piano Keys on-platform project

## Challenges

**Piano Keys** | I had to watch the 'Get Unstuck' video walkthrough to figure out how to start the project.
