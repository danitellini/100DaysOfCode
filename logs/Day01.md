# Day 01: 1 January 2025

> **Goal**: Complete the Colmar Academy Project

## What I Learned

- JavaScript Iterators
  - `.forEach()` is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns `undefined`.
  - `.map()` executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
  - `.filter()` checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
  - `.findIndex()` returns the index of the first element of an array that satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns `-1` if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition.
  - `.reduce()` iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value.
  - All iterator methods take a callback function, which can be a pre-defined function, a function expression, or an arrow function.
  - Completed the Grammar Checker project on-platform.
- Colmar Academy Project
  - Finished a bit of the banner

## Challenges

**JS Iterators** | I've been using the ES6 implementation exclusively to get used to the major shorthand. Reading and using the traditional function syntax is much easier to me, but I need to understand the different ways.

**Colmar Academy Project** | I'm having trouble getting the banner container to act appropriately with the text size. It keeps resizing the picture when it shouldn't when I adjust the margins/padding.
