## Challenges

The only challenge I had when completing this project was the amount of time it took me to be able to sit down and finish it after starting in early December. This is the final project of the [Build  a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites) course at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).
