# Day 6: 7 January 2025

> **Goal**: Complete Company Home Page Project

## What I Accomplished

- Completed CP: Company Home Page

## Challenges

- The flexbox cards were proving difficult for a while, but I managed to get them to mostly work in the end. I did notice that my photos (specifically of the 4 imaginary team members) are not sizing appropriately. The photos are centered when they shrink/grow. I will need to adjust them to flex-start, maybe?
