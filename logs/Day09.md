> **Goal**: Complete Responsive Club Website project

## What I Accomplished

- `document` keyword grants access to root of DOM in JS
- `.querySelector()` method in DOM interface allows to select a specific element with CSS selectors
- `.getElementById()` method allows access to an element directly by its ID
- `.getElementsByClassName()` and `.getElementsByTagName()` methods allow access to an array of elements, also allowing a single element to be called by referencing its index
- `.innerHTML` and `.style` properties allow for modification of an element by changing it's contents or style respectively
- `.createElement()`, `.appendChild()`, and `.removeChild()` methods create, append, and remove elements
- `.onclick` property can add interactivity to a DOM element based on a click event
- `.children` property returns a list of an element's children
- `.parentNode` property returns the element's closest connected node in the directions towards the root
