# Day 5: 5 January 2025

> **Goal**: ~Complete Colmar Academy Project~

## What I Learned

- Completed the Lodash Project
- Finished the JavaScript Syntax Part II
- Attempted to continue with Colmar Academy project
- Reviewed Flexbox
  - `display: flex` - changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.
  - `display: inline-flex` - allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.
  - `justify-content` - position the items from left to right.
    - `flex-start` — all items will be positioned in order, starting from the left of the parent container, with no extra space between or before them.
    - `flex-end` — all items will be positioned in order, with the last item starting on the right side of the parent container, with no extra space between or after them.
    - `center` — all items will be positioned in order, in the center of the parent container with no extra space before, between, or after them.
    - `space-around` — items will be positioned with equal space before and after each item, resulting in double the space between elements.
    - `space-between` — items will be positioned with equal space between them, but no extra space before the first or after the last elements.
  - `align-items` - makes it possible to space flex items vertically.
    - `flex-start` — all elements will be positioned at the top of the parent container.
    - `flex-end` — all elements will be positioned at the bottom of the parent container.
    - `center` — the center of all elements will be positioned halfway between the top and bottom of the parent container.
    - `baseline` — the bottom of the content of all items will be aligned with each other.
    - `stretch` — if possible, the items will stretch from top to bottom of the container (this is the default value; elements with a specified height will not stretch; elements with a minimum height or no height specified will stretch).
  - `flex-grow` - allows us to specify if items should grow to fill a container and also which items should grow proportionally more or less than others. Default: `flex-grow: 0`
  - `flex-shrink` - used to specify which elements will shrink and in what proportions. Default: `flex-shrink: 1`
  - `flex-basis` - allows us to specify the width of an item before it stretches or shrinks.
  - `flex` - allows you to declare `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` in that order all in one line.
  - `flex-wrap` - items to move to the next line when necessary. _Note_: Declared on flex containers.
    - `wrap` — child elements of a flex container that don’t fit into a row will move down to the next line.
    - `wrap-reverse` — the same functionality as `wrap`, but the order of rows within a flex container is reversed (for example, in a 2-row flexbox, the first row from a `wrap` container will become the second in `wrap-reverse` and the second row from the `wrap` container will become the first in `wrap-reverse`).
    - `nowrap` — prevents items from wrapping; this is the default value and is only necessary to override a wrap value set by a different CSS rule.
  - `align-content` - space the rows from top to bottom. _Note_: Declared on flex containers.
    - `flex-start` — all rows of elements will be positioned at the top of the parent container with no extra space between.
    - `flex-end` — all rows of elements will be positioned at the bottom of the parent container with no extra space between.
    - `center` — all rows of elements will be positioned at the center of the parent element with no extra space between.
    - `space-between` — all rows of elements will be spaced evenly from the top to the bottom of the container with no space above the first or below the last.
    - `space-around` — all rows of elements will be spaced evenly from the top to the bottom of the container with the same amount of space at the top and bottom and between each element.
    - `stretch` — if a minimum height or no height is specified, the rows of elements will stretch to fill the parent container from top to bottom (default value).
  - `flex-direction` - change the direction of the items. _Note_: Declared on flex containers.
    - `row` — elements will be positioned from left to right across the parent element starting from the top left corner (default).
    - `row-reverse` — elements will be positioned from right to left across the parent element starting from the top right corner.
    - `column` — elements will be positioned from top to bottom of the parent element starting from the top left corner.
    - `column-reverse` — elements will be positioned from the bottom to the top of the parent element starting from the bottom left corner.
  - `flex-flow` - used to declare both the `flex-wrap` and `flex-direction` properties in that order in one line. _Note_: Declared on flex containers.
- Started the Company Home Page With Flexbox Challenge Project
  - Finished the majority of the HTML

## Challenges

- Need to review flexbox lessons in course with Colmar Academy and reattempt at a later date
