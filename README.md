# #100DaysOfCode Challenge

My #100DaysOfCode Challenge Journal | Full-Stack Development Journey | Daily Logs | Frontend &amp; Backend Projects | Progress, Challenges &amp; Examples

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode Challenge! This repository documents my journey as I work toward mastering full-stack development. Here, you'll find detailed daily logs, progress on coding projects, and a checklist of my goals for the challenge.

## About the Challenge

The #100DaysOfCode Challenge is a commitment to code for at least one hour every day for 100 days. My goal is to sharpen my skills in full-stack development, tackle real-world projects, and become a better coder one day at a time.

This repository will be used for multiple #100DaysOfCode challenges. Each time I start a new challenge, the `README.md` and file structure will be updated to reflect the new challenge while preserving the logs and progress from previous challengs. I aim to keep this clutter-free!ðŸ§¹

## Checklist: Goals for the Challenge

Here are the key milestones I want to achieve during this challenge:

- [ ] Master HTML, CSS, and responsive design.
- [ ] Build projects using JavaScript (vanilla and frameworks).

- [ ] Practice working with databases (SQL and NoSQL).
- [ ] Create a full-stack application (frontend and backend).
- [ ] Explore authentication and security practices.
- [ ] Implement accessibility best practices.
- [ ] Build a portfolio website.

- [ ] Finish started projects.
